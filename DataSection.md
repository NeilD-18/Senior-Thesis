# Sentiment Analysis Datasets

Two datasets were used for the sentiment analysis component of this research: the IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset (v1.0), developed at Stanford University, and the Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset (v2.0), created at Johns Hopkins University. Together, these collections provide both an in-domain and out-of-domain corpus for evaluating model robustness to distributional shifts in textual data.

The IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset (Maas et al., 2011), released by the Stanford AI Lab, is a benchmark corpus for sentiment classification containing 50,000 highly polarized movie reviews collected from IMDB. Reviews are evenly split into 25,000 training and 25,000 testing examples, balanced between positive and negative sentiment labels. Each review is rated on a 1–10 scale, where scores ≤4 are labeled negative and scores ≥7 are labeled positive, while neutral reviews are excluded to maintain clear polarity. The dataset also includes an additional 50,000 unlabeled reviews for unsupervised learning. Importantly, the training and test sets contain disjoint sets of movies to prevent memorization of movie-specific vocabulary. This dataset is publicly available through the Stanford AI Lab at https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/. In this thesis, it serves as the primary training corpus for sentiment analysis models, which are later tested on out-of-domain Amazon reviews to evaluate robustness under distributional shift.

The Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset (Blitzer, Dredze, and Pereira, 2007), developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, contains product reviews collected from Amazon.com across multiple domains, including Books, DVDs, Electronics, and Kitchen appliances. Each review includes a star rating from one to five, which can be converted into binary sentiment labels for classification tasks. The dataset provides both raw and preprocessed formats, with balanced subsets of positive and negative examples available for each domain. The preprocessed ACL 2007 version, used in this thesis, represents each document as a bag-of-words feature vector with an associated sentiment label. Because each domain exhibits distinct vocabulary and stylistic patterns, the dataset is widely used for research on domain adaptation and cross-domain sentiment analysis. It is publicly available through the Johns Hopkins University Center for Language and Speech Processing at https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/. In this project, it serves as the out-of-domain evaluation corpus for models trained on IMDB reviews, allowing direct measurement of robustness and performance degradation under distributional shift.

# The UCI Adult Income Dataset

The Adult Income Dataset (also known as the “Census Income” dataset) was originally extracted from the 1994 U.S. Census Bureau database and is maintained by the University of California, Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository (Dua & Graff, 2019). It is one of the most widely used benchmark datasets for supervised learning, particularly for testing algorithms on classification, fairness, and robustness tasks involving structured, tabular data. The goal with this dataset is to predict whether an individual’s annual income exceeds $50,000, based on a variety of demographic and employment attributes.

The dataset contains 48,842 observations and 14 attributes, including both continuous and categorical variables. Key features include age, education, occupation, workclass, marital status, hours per week, and native country. The target variable, income, is binary—“>50K” or “≤50K.” Several attributes, such as workclass, occupation, and native-country, contain missing values represented by question marks, providing a realistic context for studying the effects of incomplete data.

Since the dataset has a combination of numerical and categorical data, it becomes particularly useful for testing algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting methods, which can handle mixed data types.

This dataset is publicly available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult. In this thesis, it serves as the primary dataset for the structured (tabular) data experiments, complementing the textual sentiment datasets (IMDB and Amazon). It is used to evaluate how classical machine learning models respond to data noise, missingness, and distributional shifts—key elements in assessing model robustness. Because the Adult dataset includes both social and economic attributes with clear decision boundaries, it provides a strong foundation for analyzing how different algorithms degrade under varying data quality conditions.


# The Airbnb Price Prediction Dataset

The Airbnb Price Prediction Dataset, available from Kaggle’s Airbnb Price Prediction competition, includes detailed information on thousands of Airbnb listings and is used to predict nightly rental prices. It provides a realistic regression problem drawn from real data, making it a good benchmark for testing how machine learning models perform when estimating continuous outcomes.

There are over 40,000 listings from multiple cities, with variables describing both the property and the host. Important features include latitude, longitude, room_type, accommodates, bedrooms, bathrooms, number_of_reviews, review_scores_rating, and price. Other details such as host_since, host_response_rate, and instant_bookable describe host behavior, while neighbourhood and city indicate location. The target variable is the price per night, recorded in U.S. dollars.

Some variables,like the number of bedrooms, number of beds, and accommodates, are highly correlated, creating multicollinearity among predictors. This makes the dataset useful for studying how models deal with overlapping or redundant information. Like the UCI Adult Income dataset, it mixes both numeric and categorical data, so it works well for testing algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting methods.

The dataset can be accessed through Kaggle’s Airbnb Price Prediction competition at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbnb-price-prediction/data. In this thesis, it serves as the main regression dataset, complementing the classification-based Adult Income data and the text-based sentiment datasets (IMDB and Amazon). It is used to explore how regression models respond to noise, missing data, and feature changes, offering another perspective on model robustness and generalization.
