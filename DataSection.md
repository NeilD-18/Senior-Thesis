# Sentiment Analysis Datasets

Two datasets were used for the sentiment analysis component of this research: the IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset (v1.0), developed at Stanford University, and the Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset (v2.0), created at Johns Hopkins University. Together, these collections provide both an in-domain and out-of-domain corpus for evaluating model robustness to distributional shifts in textual data.

The IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset (Maas et al., 2011), released by the Stanford AI Lab, is a benchmark corpus for sentiment classification containing 50,000 highly polarized movie reviews collected from IMDB. Reviews are evenly split into 25,000 training and 25,000 testing examples, balanced between positive and negative sentiment labels. Each review is rated on a 1–10 scale, where scores ≤4 are labeled negative and scores ≥7 are labeled positive, while neutral reviews are excluded to maintain clear polarity. The dataset also includes an additional 50,000 unlabeled reviews for unsupervised learning. Importantly, the training and test sets contain disjoint sets of movies to prevent memorization of movie-specific vocabulary. This dataset is publicly available through the Stanford AI Lab at https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/. In this thesis, it serves as the primary training corpus for sentiment analysis models, which are later tested on out-of-domain Amazon reviews to evaluate robustness under distributional shift.

The Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset (Blitzer, Dredze, and Pereira, 2007), developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, contains product reviews collected from Amazon.com across multiple domains, including Books, DVDs, Electronics, and Kitchen appliances. Each review includes a star rating from one to five, which can be converted into binary sentiment labels for classification tasks. The dataset provides both raw and preprocessed formats, with balanced subsets of positive and negative examples available for each domain. The preprocessed ACL 2007 version, used in this thesis, represents each document as a bag-of-words feature vector with an associated sentiment label. Because each domain exhibits distinct vocabulary and stylistic patterns, the dataset is widely used for research on domain adaptation and cross-domain sentiment analysis. It is publicly available through the Johns Hopkins University Center for Language and Speech Processing at https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/. In this project, it serves as the out-of-domain evaluation corpus for models trained on IMDB reviews, allowing direct measurement of robustness and performance degradation under distributional shift.
